 * Class Description: A value-oriented List data collection ADT.
 * Class Invariant: Data collection with the following characteristics:
 *                   - Each element is unique (no duplicates).
 *                   - It is sorted by ascending sort order of its elements.
 *                   - Its data structure is expandable: when full, it expands to accommodate 
 *                     new insertion. This is done unbeknown to the client code.
